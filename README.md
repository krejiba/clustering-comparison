# Comparison of clustering algorithms | Scikit-learn
This is a personal project using Python. We compare the performance of clustering algorithms on different datasets.

### How to use :
You need to download all the files in your working directory. Make sure to install NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn in order to make use of this code. We will also be using Matplotlib to visualize our results. You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can use the notebook by typing jupyter notebook clustering.ipynb in the command line. A new window will open in your browser.
You can run all code by clicking on "Cell" -> "Run All".
